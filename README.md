# NLP Tutorials

A collection of hands-on Jupyter notebooks for learning **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** step by step, starting from **text pre-processing** and gradually moving towards more advanced topics.

This repository is meant to be a practical companion while you learn NLP concepts, experiment with real code, and build intuition using simple, clear examples.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a solid intuition for core NLP concepts.
- Learn **how** and **why** each pre-processing step is used.
- Provide ready-to-run **Jupyter notebooks** you can play with.
- Serve as a base to extend into more advanced NLP workflows.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```text
NLP-Tutorials/
├── Pre-processing/
│   └── <Notebooks for text pre-processing in Jupyter>
└── .DS_Store (auto-generated by macOS, can be ignored)
````

### `Pre-processing/` (Current focus)

This folder contains notebooks that typically cover topics like:

* Loading and inspecting raw text
* Lowercasing and basic text cleaning
* Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters
* Tokenization (splitting text into words/tokens)
* Stopword removal
* Stemming and Lemmatization
* Basic vectorization ideas (like Bag-of-Words, etc., if included)

> As you add more notebooks (e.g., for embeddings, sequence models, transformers), they can be organized in new folders like `Feature-Engineering/`, `Classical-ML/`, `Deep-Learning/`, etc.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asphane/NLP-Tutorials.git
cd NLP-Tutorials
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

**On macOS / Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the main libraries commonly used for NLP experiments:

```bash
pip install jupyter notebook numpy pandas nltk spacy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

(You can add or remove libraries based on what each notebook uses.)

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, in the Jupyter interface:

1. Navigate to the `Pre-processing/` folder.
2. Open any `.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells one by one and experiment with the code.

---

## 🧪 What You Can Do With These Notebooks

* Try out different tokenization strategies on your own text.
* Compare stemming vs lemmatization on sample sentences.
* See how pre-processing changes model inputs.
* Add your own functions and cells to extend the workflow.
* Use these notebooks as a template for your own NLP projects.

---

## 🧱 Suggested Extensions (Future Ideas)

You can extend this repository with new folders and notebooks, for example:

* `Feature-Engineering/`

  * TF–IDF
  * N-grams
  * Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.)

* `Classical-ML/`

  * Text classification with Naive Bayes / SVM / Logistic Regression
  * Sentiment analysis on basic datasets

* `Deep-Learning/`

  * RNN/LSTM/GRU text models
  * Sequence classification and tagging

* `Transformers/`

  * Using BERT or other transformer models for classification
  * Fine-tuning on custom datasets

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome!
You can:

* Add new notebooks for different NLP concepts.
* Improve explanations or markdown cells inside notebooks.
* Refactor code for clarity and modularity.
* Add example datasets or links to open datasets.

Before contributing:

1. Keep notebooks **clean** (clear outputs if needed).
2. Add short **markdown explanations** for each major code block.
3. Use clear, consistent naming for files and functions.
